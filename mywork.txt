Clean and Prepare the Data:

    Combine Date and Time into a DateTime column.
    Drop the Unnamed: 0 column.
    Convert min, avg, and max columns to numeric types.
    Handle missing or invalid values, if any.
Analyze and Visualize the Data:

    Perform resampling for hourly, daily, and weekly summaries.
    Calculate descriptive statistics.
    Generate visualizations to explore trends and variability.

    index :
     min: Minimum energy consumption.
    avg: Average energy consumption.
    max: Maximum energy consumption.
    DateTime: Combined timestamp.

and then Resample the data to create hourly, daily, and weekly summaries.
Resample the data to create hourly, daily, and weekly summaries.
Generate visualizations to identify trends, distributions, and peak times.

Visualize Trends: Generate line plots to visualize daily energy consumption trends.
Analyze Distributions: Create histograms to study the spread of energy consumption values.
Highlight Peak Demand: Pinpoint the peak demand date on the visualizations.


Descriptive Analysis: Outputs insights like mean, median, variance, and peak demand.
AI Optimization Model: Evaluates Linear Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forests. Selects the best-performing model based on R².
Model Validation: Uses MAE, RMSE, and R² for performance evaluation.
Visualizations: Includes trend analysis and distribution plots.
